Date of Project Proposal Submission: 23.06.23

Project Name: Web Scanning and Machine Learning for High-Tech Job Prediction

Research Question: How can web scanning and machine learning be utilized to predict whether the next job posted will be associated with the high-tech category or not?

Formulation of the Research Question: What will be the classification of the job according to the keywords found in the job description?

General Explanation of the Project:

The project aims to predict whether a job posted online falls into the high-tech category or not. This will be achieved through web scanning techniques to collect job listing data from selected portals, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify the job based on keywords found in the job description.

Sources of Information + Links:

The main sources of information will be job portals such as "alljobs.co.il".

Data Collection Method:

Web scanning will be used to collect job listing data from the selected job portals. The amount of data collected will depend on the number of job listings available on the portals and the frequency of data collection.

What does each row in the dataset represent?

Each row in the dataset represents a job listing from the collected data.

What does each column in the dataset represent?

Job Title: The title of the job listing.
Job Description: Description of responsibilities and job requirements.
Required Skills: The skills required for the position.

Machine Learning Type:

The machine learning type used in this project is supervised learning, specifically classification.
